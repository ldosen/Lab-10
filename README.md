Objectives
An understanding of the following concepts and techniques:

Graph ADT
Graph algorithms
Libraries for working with graphs
Instructions
In this lab, you will have the opportunity to represent a geographical map as a graph and manipulate this graph in various useful ways.

Specifically:

Create a new Gradle-based project based on one of your earlier projects:

define a main class
define a separate class for the country codes (see below)
JGraphT library dependency - visit this page and put the dependency information for Gradle in the dependencies section of your build.gradle
don't forget to include a .gitignore
remove everything you don't need
Pick any country in the world (or state/province/territory/department within a single country) that has at least five neighbors with which it shares a border of length > 0 (a corner doesn't count).

Define string constants for the country and its immediate neighbors, preferably using the corresponding ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.

 final static String AT = "Austria";
 final static String DE = "Germany";
 ...
Using the JGraphT library, define a graph representing the map limited to the country you picked and its immediate neighbors. Concretely, define a graph instance, add a vertex for each country, then add an edge for each pair of neighboring countries. (Because this is an undirected graph, you need to add only one edge for each pair of neighboring countries.)

 final Graph<String, DefaultEdge> myMap = new SimpleGraph<>(DefaultEdge.class);
 myMap.addVertex(AT);
 myMap.addVertex(DE);
 ...
 myMap.addEdge(AT, DE);
 ...
Then print the resulting graph.

Traverse the graph using the following different traversal algorithms (in org.grapht.traverse):

BreadthFirstIterator
ClosestFirstIterator
DepthFirstIterator
RandomWalkIterator
For each of these algorithms, use both your central country and a country on the edge of your map as starting points. For each combination of country and traversal algorithm, print the resulting iteration sequence.

Example:

 final Iterator<String> bf = new BreadthFirstIterator<>(myMap, DE);
 while (bf.hasNext()) {
   final String country = bf.next();
   ...
 }
Written part: Discuss the differences among the results. Does the starting point make a difference?

Using JGraphT's GreedyColoring or other coloring algorithm, find out how many colors are required to color your map in such a way that no two adjacent countries have the same color. Concretely, create an instance of GreedyColoring for your map, then generate and print the coloring.

Fun fact: For any idealized map (planar graph), this requires at most four colors.

Written part: Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.
